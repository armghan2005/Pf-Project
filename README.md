US-SHEIN-Appliances Data Cleaning Project
Overview
This repository contains the cleaned version of the us-shein-appliances.csv dataset. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to prepare it for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Clean the us-shein-appliances.csv dataset by handling issues such as missing data, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Ensure the data is in a format suitable for further analysis, visualization, or machine learning.
Files in this Repository
us-shein-appliances.csv: Original dataset.
cleaned_us-shein-appliances.csv: Cleaned version of the dataset (after preprocessing).
data_cleaning.py: Python script used to clean the data (if applicable).
Tools & Libraries
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation, including data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
NumPy: For numerical operations, such as handling NaN values and performing efficient computations on large datasets.
Data Cleaning Steps
The following steps were applied to clean the data:

Loading Data:

The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from the CSV file using pandas.read_csv().
Handling Missing Values:

Missing values were identified and treated either by filling with default values or dropping rows/columns when necessary.
Removing Duplicates:

Duplicate rows were removed to ensure data quality.
Converting Data Types:

Columns with incorrect or inconsistent data types were converted to the appropriate types (e.g., numeric, date).
Handling Outliers & Invalid Data:

Outliers and invalid data points were detected and addressed to avoid skewing analysis.
Standardizing Data:

Data was standardized, including text normalization and proper date formatting.
How to Use
To load and begin working with the cleaned dataset, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us-shein-appliances.git
cd us-shein-appliances
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy
Load the cleaned dataset in Python:
python
Copy
import pandas as pd

# Load the cleaned dataset
data = pd.read_csv('cleaned_us-shein-appliances.csv')

# View the first few rows of the cleaned dataset
print(data.head())
Example of Data Cleaning Code
If you're interested in the cleaning process itself, you can view the data_cleaning.py script (if applicable). This script contains all the steps performed during the cleaning process.
